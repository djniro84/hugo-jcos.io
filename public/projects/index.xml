      <description>Islas de Gigantes, Carles, Philippines
Hello,
Just sharing this photo here since it&amp;#8217;s getting some traction in Unsplash.
This is one of my photos taken when I was travelling to Ilo Ilo last year.
I was too lazy to write something about the trip with the other photos.
Feels good to see this being used by other people.
Please do check out Anita&amp;#8217;s 45 Of The Most Stunning Paradises Around The World Happy travelling!</description>

      <description>Had a quick gig on the Disney Aulani site when I was still at RCG.
Mostly worked on the front-end implementation of redesign.
Just did the CSS and a little template here and there.
  So starting from this page until checkout are what I&amp;#8217;ve worked on this project.
It was straightforward but there were many changes done.

      <description>My first project using WordPress and working with Dart back in September 2013. Developed a WordPress child theme of twentyeleven from an already designed HTML template.
Second redesign was around March of 2015. The new theme was a responsive theme with a request to add a survey to get user feedback. The survey is mandatory and needs to be finished first before viewers can access the content.
Redesign results shows that it engages more users to access the site especially those that are using mobile devices, better ways to improve the website by taking into account viewer feedback and demographics.</description>

      <description>One of the projects with Dart. This involves lots of customization to themes and especially WooCommerce.
The projects is an online shop but for registered members only. Since this is a niche site and shop a customized wish-list was placed to inquire about items. Built using Bootstrap, Parallax, Masonry Galleries and other design requests this is one of the bandwidth-heavy sites I&amp;#8217;ve created. Forgot to mention that videos was used as background for home and contact pages.</description>
