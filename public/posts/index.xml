            <description>Islas de Gigantes, Carles, Philippines
Hello,
Just sharing this photo here since it&amp;#8217;s getting some traction in Unsplash.
This is one of my photos taken when I was travelling to Ilo Ilo last year.
I was too lazy to write something about the trip with the other photos.
Feels good to see this being used by other people.
Please do check out Anita&amp;#8217;s 45 Of The Most Stunning Paradises Around The World Happy travelling!</description>

            <description>Model Kit:    SD Gundam EX-Standard Sinanju  Trying something different with the layouts.  Also playing around with changing the Gundam&amp;#8217;s color with this one.   Before   After   A quick edit with colors.
Changing from red to blue and the guns near the eyes.
More practice with glowing things like the gun scopes and eye.
Sometime in the future I would like to paint this.</description>

            <description>Model Kit: SD Gundam Cross Silhouette Crossbone Gundam X1
Hello, here we are again with another GIMP Complete.
I finished over during the holidays. Had some problems using my Mother&amp;#8217;s laptop. It was just shutting down without warning.
Can&amp;#8217;t blame the laptop since it&amp;#8217;s really old. Stopped running Windows XP and had to reformat with Linux.
LXLE made it usable again but that&amp;#8217;s a story for another time.
Setting up I need to get some base to pose the Gundam in the air.</description>

<p>Hello, here we are again with another GIMP Complete.</p>

<p>I finished over during the holidays. Had some problems using my Mother&#8217;s laptop. It was just shutting down without warning.</p>

<p>Can&#8217;t blame the laptop since it&#8217;s really old. Stopped running Windows XP and had to reformat with Linux.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.lxle.net/" target="_blank">LXLE</a> made it usable again but that&#8217;s a story for another time.</p>

<h2 id="setting-up">Setting up</h2>

<p>I need to get some base to pose the Gundam in the air.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve tried with a pink background with a folder then to make it stand with a chopstick in between two dumbbell.</p>

<p>Well gotta improvise until a proper base.</p>

<p>There are some new things I&#8217;ve done here.</p>

<p>Multiple color changes of parts.</p>

<p>What I like the most was the chest since that ended up looking normal.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve also did a lot of detailing especially in the face and the Crossbones.</p>

<p>Tried changing the gun to be a lightsaber but it doesn&#8217;t look so good.</p>

<p>This was take from the <a href="https://jcos.io/build-complete-sd-gundam-ex-standard-sinanju-sd/" target="_blank">Sinanju</a> to have a dual wielding effect.</p>

<p>Didn&#8217;t remove the background cleanly so I used the white background to make it look like it was very bright.</p>

            <description>This is my first take on painting with GIMP.
Subject is the Gundam Deathscythe-Hell EW version.
Practicing adding glowing things to eyes and the scythe.
Before 
After 
I got some more posts coming up. Cleaning up the Gundam Crossbones and working on the SD Sinanju.
Still 2 more SD then moving on to my MG kit or get some HG for practice.
This is actually quite relaxing. Haven&amp;#8217;t opened Steam in a while.</description>

Getting the hang of it now. My brother has been building an HG kit and he said it took him around 3 hours or more so looking at 2 more SDs then going for an HG or straight to my MG on stand by.

            <description>So after looking around on how to paint and what best way to do this I ended up coloring and working on this using my computer.
This is the previous SD we built &amp;#8211; Wing Gundam EW
Before editing using GIMP Before editing
After editing Cleaned up some nubs, changes colors and a lot more easier done.

Pros of using computer  Cheaper I didn&amp;#8217;t have to buy any paint Faster, it is seen asap.</description>

<h2 id="pros-of-using-computer">Pros of using computer</h2>

<ul>
<li>Cheaper I didn&#8217;t have to buy any paint</li>
<li>Faster, it is seen asap. Does not need to wait for paint to dry.</li>
<li>Can look really good depending on skill level. (Still starting out, my second shot at this)</li>
<li>Can easily remove nubs as well</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="cons">Cons</h2>

<ul>
<li>Can&#8217;t really display the finished product since only digital</li>
<li>Sometimes it&#8217;s hard to use mouse with drawings</li>
<li>That&#8217;s all I can think for now</li>
</ul>

<p>Only video I saw so far which I used for reference &#8211;</p>

<h2 id="tools-for-editing">Tools for editing</h2>

<ul>
<li>GIMP</li>
</ul>

<p>GIMP because it&#8217;s free and this is only a hobby I do when there&#8217;s time to spare so no need for Photoshop.</p>

<p>Yeah that&#8217;s it for now. Just a lot of googling and see what looks good.</p>

            <description>Here we go again with one of the last SD kits I&amp;#8217;m building.
Would want to do some bigger and cooler kits but we&amp;#8217;ll see.
Funding is a big constraint, the prices of model kits here are expensive as hell. It&amp;#8217;s like they replaced the Yen with Pesos but same currency or more.
Maybe I can get one every payday. Maybe&amp;#8230;. or more&amp;#8230;.
Anyway we have this Gundam Crossbones. He looks like a pirate, I&amp;#8217;m not familiar with the story but he sure looks cool.</description>

<p>Photos of building SD kits, these are really getting easier the more kits I work on.</p>

<p>Same old process of cutting the pieces then slapping them together. I didn&#8217;t bother taking extra care when removing the pieces since I&#8217;ll be editing them out with GIMP later.</p>

<p>A little different with the arms but overall it&#8217;s the same.</p>

<h2 id="something-different">Something different</h2>

<p>I&#8217;ve intentionally not added the stickers except for the eyes. I&#8217;ll try working on this later on the computer.</p>

<p>Photo editing the colors and details. I&#8217;ll be calling this Photoshop since that&#8217;s what it&#8217;s commonly called but I&#8217;ll be using <a href="https://www.gimp.org/" target="_blank">GIMP</a> later.</p>

            <description>KIT: SD Gundam EX-Standard Wing Gundam Zero EW Series: Gundam Wing We have another SD from Gundam Wing.
The Gundam of Heero Yuy. It&amp;#8217;s really cool but I like the Deathscythe more, personal preference I guess.
I wanted to start painting but currently still looking and learning from tutorials online.
I&amp;#8217;m not sure if this EW batch of SD have all of the EW Gundams but it would be great to collect all.</description>

            <description>I&amp;#8217;ve actually posted the edited version first in GIMP Complete
Model Kit: SD Gundam EX-Standard Gundam Deathscythe-Hell EW
I enjoy building these kits then posing them around then taking photos.
Figured I can edit them to add details then clean up nubs.
Picture time!                Tried editing the background out and replacing with space.

<p>I enjoy building these kits then posing them around then taking photos.</p>

<p>Figured I can edit them to add details then clean up nubs.</p>

            <description>Some info Last week I got back from Japan. Write about Japan Trip here&amp;#8230; &amp;lt;- Future link
While I was there, the toys especially Gundam kits seems cheaper so I picked up a couple.
Built my first Gundam The first Gundam series I saw was Gundam Wing in our local channel GMA 7 when I was a kid.
Duo&amp;#8217;s Deathscythe was my favorite and was really lucky I got to pick this up.</description>

<p>Last week I got back from Japan. Write about Japan Trip here&#8230; &lt;- Future link</p>

<p>While I was there, the toys especially Gundam kits seems cheaper so I picked up a couple.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve had some toys like this when I was a little so it was fairly easy.</p>

<p>Follow the instructions even if written in Japanese is clear. We can follow the images on which parts go to where.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s some pics I took when doing the pieces.</p>

<h2 id="i-need-more">I need more</h2>

<p>I think I&#8217;m addicted to this new hobby. I&#8217;ve been planning to collect Gundams before since I had one kit when I was a kid and then realized that they&#8217;re expensive.</p>

<p>Currently reading and watching tutorials on painting and other stuff.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not contented with the stickers when looking at other cool builds on the internet.</p>

<p>Also haven&#8217;t played a game when I got back.</p>

<p>Working on other SDs to get the hang of it.</p>

<h2 id="tldr">TLDR</h2>

<p>Got and built a Gundam kit and hooked.</p>

<p>Know where to buy Gundam that ships internationally? Any good tutorials for beginner on painting?</p>

<p>Want to share your builds?</p>

<p>I&#8217;d love to talk and hear your recommendations.</p>

            <description>Hey there! Just finished Crashlands. I really enjoyed every session and lost some sleep. Just one more recipeee!!!
Crashlands was released in 2016, I was pretty late for the party but no worries still got to play it. It went on sale some time ago on Steam and Google play so I went with the Android version since I thought I might be able to play that more often(Also cheaper).</description>

<p>Hey there! Just finished Crashlands. I really enjoyed every session and lost some sleep. Just one more recipeee!!!<br />
Crashlands was released in 2016, I was pretty late for the party but no worries still got to play it. It went on sale some time ago on Steam and Google play so I went with the Android version since I thought I might be able to play that more often(Also cheaper).</p>

<h2 id="gameplay"><strong>Gameplay</strong></h2>

<p>The game focuses on crafting and battles to get items needed for crafting. Seems really simple but there is a lot to it.</p>

<p>On later stages the game could get a little grindy but not to the point that it feels like a slog.</p>

<p>There are lots to do in the games. Craft stuff, craft weapons, furniture and more.</p>

<h2 id="story"><strong>Story</strong></h2>

<p>Main character is Flux Dabes, She is a she but I was it was in the middle of the game where I realized that.</p>

<p>Bet she&#8217;s hot under that infinisuit. She is a shipping expert and the story mostly revolves around delivering the packages.</p>

<p>Another important character is Juicebox the robot that allows follows you around. Juicebox&#8217;s dialogues are entertaining and hilarious.</p>

<p>I also like the pacing of the story. Feels about right.</p>

<h2 id="tldr"><strong>TLDR</strong></h2>

<p>If you are thinking about playing a new game with great fun story and can keep you entertained for hours get this game now. Even better when on sale but It&#8217;s worth it. There are also some achievements/perks among other ButterScotch games.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s also a nice story of how they start up working on Crashlands.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thinking of adding gameplay videos here on another post.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>That&#8217;s all for now.</p>

<p>Until next game, bye!</p>

            <description>Hello! I&amp;#8217;m here again. Adding some updates and changing some stuff around here.
How are you doing?
So I was thinking about some stuff. When I first created my website it was just so I can create one for myself.
To be able to add to my resume. Thought it could come handy during interviews like &amp;#8220;Hey I have experience with WordPress and stuff. Check my email I use my own domain&amp;#8221; then I was learning a lot.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hello! I&#8217;m here again. Adding some updates and changing some stuff around here.</p>

<p>How are you doing?</p>

<p>So I was thinking about some stuff. When I first created my website it was just so I can create one for myself.</p>

<p>To be able to add to my resume. Thought it could come handy during interviews like &#8220;Hey I have experience with WordPress and stuff. Check my email I use my own domain&#8221; then I was learning a lot.</p>

<p>There were some ideas of monetizing it, adding some ads, selling stuff but now I&#8217;ve decided to just write stuff.</p>

<p>Maybe the readers and the ads will come in time but that is not the target now.</p>

<p>With this I think I&#8217;ll be able to add more stuff since I&#8217;m not concerned about how many words in a post, does it pass SEO checklists. I&#8217;ve remove the ads. There are useless since there aren&#8217;t that many viewers and posts anyways. LOL</p>

<p>For now I&#8217;ll just make this like my personal page or something like my Facebook wall. Post whatever I want without anymore guidelines to follow. There were some stuff I was into back then like &#8220;How to get reader&#8217;s attention with titles&#8221;, &#8220;Make quality content to get followers&#8221;, &#8220;<a href="http://jcos.io/ways-make-money-website/" target="_blank">How to monetize your website</a>&#8221; and so on.</p>

<p>Since I just use Facebook for messenger. (People are still easier to contact with Facebook/Messenger)</p>

<p>I have a feeling I&#8217;ll be able to update this more often now.</p>

<p>Also, I&#8217;ve updated the homepage. I really like it a lot better now with the skate park.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s all for now.</p>

<p>See ya</p>

            <description>Good time to go to beach Was getting burnt out after a really hard project.
I didn&amp;#8217;t like beaches because it&amp;#8217;s hot and I don&amp;#8217;t know how to swim.
Somehow when trying out surfing it was really fun.
It&amp;#8217;s like skating but on waves!
Plus it doesn&amp;#8217;t hurt as much when falling into water.
 &amp;nbsp;
Now on to catching bigger waves&amp;#8230;
Oh. Need to learn how to swim first.</description>

            <description>Well hello there! Got some new toys from humblebundle.com. Pretty good deal at $15 you get 7-8 games.
First time in a while playing some games that actually have and ending.
For some time I was into MMORPGs, DoTA, mobile games(Clash of Clans, Summoners War) but sometimes it&amp;#8217;s good to go back to basics.
Back in the day you play games until you see The End, Fin.
It was a really good feeling to watch the credits.</description>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll be busy playing the Borderlands series included in the bundle. Feels refreshing to play single player story games again.</p>

<p>Now time to play. Starting with Borderlands.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Until next game!</p>

            <description>One day, there was a boy who went to hang out with his friends.
There they had a couple of couple of beers.
After some time he got drunk and went home.
When he woke up he remembered the Ukelele they were playing.
He was still dizzy and could throw up but he went for his guitar then went into the wheatfield&amp;#8230;&amp;#8230;
And poof! it became Koko Krunch&amp;#8230;&amp;#8230;&amp;#8230;. Errr the video below.</description>

            <description>This here is the credit card debt(Death).
The idea of puns and credit card debt(Death) I wanted to start with drawing stuff like these for a long time and share it. If my memory serves me right, I was talking about this idea with my friends and drew it for more details.
After all, a picture is worth a thousand words.
We know the bad of having credit cards and even worse if you are deep and maxed it.</description>

            <description>You can also make money from your website. While most of the time it is only used for displaying your products or your company information
We&amp;#8217;ll be talking on ways to get some cash back from just having a website online. Regarding how much and how big or small you get, your mileage may vary.
Back on topic now, Here comes my list:  Place advertisements This is a very common way to get some income, you only need to get an advertiser and place their ads on your website.</description>

<p>You can also make money from your website.  While most of the time it is only used for displaying your products or your company information<br />
We&#8217;ll be talking on ways to get some cash back from just having a website online. Regarding how much and how big or small you get, your mileage may vary.</p>

<h2 id="back-on-topic-now-here-comes-my-list">Back on topic now, Here comes my list:</h2>

<ol>
<li><h3 id="place-advertisements">Place advertisements</h3>

<p>This is a very common way to get some income, you only need to get an advertiser and place their ads on your website. Google Adsense is one of the most popular ad networks. You can also sell ad space for fixed amount per month.</p>

<p><!-- END LINK --></li></p>

<ul>
<li><h3 id="affiliate-marketing">Affiliate Marketing</h3>

<p>“Affiliate marketing is a type of performance-based marketing in which a business rewards one or more affiliates for each visitor or customer brought by the affiliate&#8217;s own marketing efforts.” Is what shows up when you search for it while in my definition, you simply help a company sell their products then they give you a commission. This is done by placing ads(See number 1) or writing a review of a product and recommend it to customers.</p>

<p><!-- END LINK --></li></p>

<ul>
<li><h3 id="sponsored-reviews">Sponsored Reviews</h3>

<p>The same as Advertisements and Affiliate Marketing, you write a review for a company and you can charge before you do the writing. You will be writing some good reviews to convince people to buy your sponsor&#8217;s products.</li></p>

<ul>
<li><h3 id="sell-products">Sell Products</h3>

<p>Yes, this couldn&#8217;t be more obvious. You can setup an online shop or just present a single product you are focused on.</li></p>

<ul>
<li><h3 id="accept-tips-donations">Accept Tips/Donations</h3>

<p>Some people don&#8217;t really intend to do this but if they have done something really cool, others want to give something. I think you should provide something valuable like a really cool wallpaper, an amazing app for free or a website template to get people to send you money.<br />
These can come in the form of Paypal Donate buttons, “Buy me a beer”, “Support us”, “Give lunch money”.</li></p>

<ul>
<li><h3 id="using-it-as-a-marketing-tool">Using it as a marketing tool</h3>

<p>Out of all the items in the list here, this is what worked for me. When I was looking for web development jobs sometime around 2013, I think having a website increased my chance to get hired.<br />
What better way to show that you can do something by sending them over to your website.</p>

<p>Something like this: “You can view my resume and portfolio at my website.”</li> </ol></p>

<p>So, that&#8217;s it for now. These are some of the ways people make money online. I have experienced setting up most of these on websites I manage.<br />
Did I miss something or you have other ways to share? I’d love to get some feedback.</p>

            <description>Finding an unused domain name is hard, finding available short domains is even harder.
Last Christmas I got myself this new domain for my URL shortener. JCOS.IO yeah!
Nice present for myself.
I just finished setting it up again because I was busy with work and with life these past few months.
There was a problem with my previous install.
A little introduction to URL shorteners. They make your links short.</description>

<p>Finding an unused domain name is hard, finding available short domains is even harder.</p>

<p>Last Christmas I got myself this new domain for my URL shortener. JCOS.IO yeah!</p>

<p>Nice present for myself.</p>

<p>I just finished setting it up again because I was busy with work and with life these past few months.</p>

<p>There was a problem with my previous install.</p>

<h2 id="a-little-introduction-to-url-shorteners-they-make-your-links-short-that-is-all">A little introduction to URL shorteners. They make your links short. That is all. 😀</h2>

<p>Why would you want to do that???</p>

<p>For example on twitter, the number of characters per tweet is limited to 140 characters. So if you have a really cool link you need to share to your followers and friends no matter what.</p>

<p>“OMGSH!!! hey check out this really cool site. the squirrel is on a jet pack with laser guns and shoots when you click!!! <a href="http://www.omglasergunspewpewpew.com/" target="_blank">http://www.omglasergunspewpewpew.com/</a>”</p>

<p>This won&#8217;t do because this exceeds twitter&#8217;s tweet limit. By shortening our link we can be sure that the awesomeness will be shared.</p>

<p>“OMGSH!!! hey check out this really cool site. the squirrel is on a jet pack with laser guns and shoots when you click!!! url.jcos.io/omgpewpew &#8211; <a href="http://www.omglasergunspewpewpew.com/" target="_blank">http://www.omglasergunspewpewpew.com/</a>”</p>

<p>Above example also exceeds tweet limit but you get the point.</p>

<p>Usually we&#8217;ll go to Bitly or TinyURL for our shortening needs but YOURLS lets us do the same on our own server. It even means Your Own URL Shortener and it&#8217;s free!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not going into details about how to set it up there are many other sites which provide detailed and easy to follow instructions like the following:</p>

<p><a href="http://url.jcos.io/2" target="_blank">http://url.jcos.io/2</a> &#8211; <a href="https://lifehacker.com/sucking-is-the-first-step-to-being-sorta-good-at-somet-1553829831" target="_blank">https://lifehacker.com/sucking-is-the-first-step-to-being-sorta-good-at-somet-1553829831</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Even the instructions on yourls homepage is clear enough.</p>

<p><a href="http://url.jcos.io/url/6" target="_blank">http://url.jcos.io/url/6</a> &#8211; <a href="http://yourls.org/#Install" target="_blank">http://yourls.org/#Install</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve also read that getting your own domain for URL shortener is great for branding. That&#8217;s cool if you&#8217;re into that thing. Branding, marketing and stuff.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Let me know if you&#8217;d like some help with setting up your own yourls by leaving a comment below.</p>

<p>OR you can also reach me on twitter: <a href="http://url.jcos.io/twitter" target="_blank">http://url.jcos.io/twitter</a> &#8211; <a href="https://twitter.com/sudoist" target="_blank">https://twitter.com/sudoist</a> or linkedin: <a href="http://url.jcos.io/linkedin" target="_blank">http://url.jcos.io/linkedin</a> &#8211; <a href="https://ph.linkedin.com/in/johncosio" target="_blank">https://ph.linkedin.com/in/johncosio</a> or <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">facebook: <a href="http://url.jcos.io/facebook" target="_blank">http://url.jcos.io/facebook</a></span> hehehe</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>

<p>As I&#8217;m moving to Digital Ocean and using jcos.io as primary domain, I think I won&#8217;t be needing to use a url shortener for now.</p>

<p>Added the original links and it really shortens stuff but I don&#8217;t even use twitter now so&#8230; Yeahhhh taking it down now.</p>

            <description>When I started setting up my websites on wordpress.com and blogspot.com I have one goal in mind. To earn some extra MONEY. Yup that is correct, after reading so many articles, guides and tutorials on writing blog posts and making money from your blog; I decided to give it a try.
The problem is after having signing up with those blogging services and customizing how your site looks, you don&amp;#8217;t have anything on it.</description>

<p>When I started setting up my websites on <a href="http://wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wordpress.com</a> and <a href="http://blogspot.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blogspot.com</a> I have one goal in mind. To earn some extra MONEY. Yup that is correct, after reading so many articles, guides and tutorials on writing blog posts and making money from your blog; I decided to give it a try.</p>

<p>The problem is after having signing up with those blogging services and customizing how your site looks, you don&#8217;t have anything on it. I find it hard to write something about anything. This continued on my self-hosted WordPress sites.</p>

<p>I read this article at lifehacker: <a href="http://url.jcos.io/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><a href="http://url.jcos.io/1" target="_blank">http://url.jcos.io/1</a></a> sometime ago.</p>

<p>It kind of makes sense, I suck at writing and I don&#8217;t have great and world changing topics to write about.</p>

<h2 id="here-is-what-usually-happens-when-trying-to-write-something-before">Here is what usually happens when trying to write something before:</h2>

<ul>
<li>You look for a topic with search keywords and stuff</li>
<li>You make a draft about it</li>
<li>It must be long for proper SEO and minimum words</li>
<li>You don&#8217;t publish until you think people will like it and it should be helpful and stuff for them views</li>
<li>It never gets published</li>
<li>When you look at it after a long time, you don&#8217;t want to publish it anymore</li>
<li>It is now forgotten. The end.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="some-thoughts">Some thoughts</h2>

<p>When my other website expired with some of my posts(around 5) in a span of a year. Really low publishing rate. I got caught in the trap above. So here is where &#8220;Sucking Is the First Step to Being Sorta Good at Something&#8221; comes in. I can now write short and whatever posts.</p>

<p>It doesn&#8217;t have to be very good, it just have to be published. Like prototyping and agile in programming, you get the product out and then you improve it based on customer feedback but in writing… maybe experience&#8230;.</p>

<p>I stopped trying to write really good, perfect and helpful stuff, I just write….. anything. Anything that I can think of. Look at this post for example, it&#8217;s all over the place.<br />
Even the punctuation and the grammar could be wrong but whatever man. I&#8217;m still writing anyway.</p>

<p>Short story long. Write and write until you improve then write some more. As programmers say(I read it somewhere but I can&#8217;t find it when searching) You don&#8217;t become good, you just become less bad.</p>

<p>Oh and about that making money from blog. I never made any anyway. Site&#8217;s got no traffic, no ads = no income.<br />
Well in a way, we can say I did. Indirectly. When I showed it to people during interviews.<br />
Make something to show that you can.</p>

<p>My goal now is to flood this site with blog posts and make jcos.io show up in Google’s number 1 spot when searching John Cosio. What will being on number 1 do? I don&#8217;t know, I just me to want to be there. Maybe I can say that <a href="http://www.johncosio.com/expert_level_over_9000/" target="_blank">I&#8217;m an expert</a> at SEO too.</p>

<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-203 size-large" src="http://johncosio.com/app/uploads/2016/08/google-search-3.jpg" alt="google search" width="550" height="650" /></p>

<p>Oh and being sorta good at writing. That&#8217;s a start.</p>

<p>As you can see I&#8217;m still getting the hang of this, any tips, comments and suggestions are welcome.</p>

            <description>Hey there, I noticed this trend with some of the games I played recently and from some time ago. The game storyline involves a God like figure at the beginning then ends up to be the main antagonist or false at the end.
Spoiler Alert: Some games only reveals this when on the last boss or at the later parts of the game.
The latest game that I&amp;#8217;m currently playing is Path of Exile, I wanted to play some Action Role Playing Games after I finished the Star Craft 2: Legacy of the Void story.</description>

<p>Hey there, I noticed this trend with some of the games I played recently and from some time ago. The game storyline involves a God like figure at the beginning then ends up to be the main antagonist or false at the end.</p>

<p>Spoiler Alert: Some games only reveals this when on the last boss or at the later parts of the game.</p>

<p>The latest game that I&#8217;m currently playing is Path of Exile, I wanted to play some Action Role Playing Games after I finished the Star Craft 2: Legacy of the Void story.</p>

<p>Just played coop and single player. I suck big time with playing against other humans. I feel that I&#8217;m really getting old, my reaction time has slowed down a lot in games like Star Craft where there are so many things happening.</p>

<h2 id="recent-games-with-this-example">Recent games with this example</h2>

<p>[spoiler title=&#8221;Spoiler Alert&#8221;]</p>

<p>Back to topic, I was at ACT IV of Path of Exile when I realized that this does have the same theme.</p>

<p>In ACT III, you would have to defeat the High Templar Dominus of the main city of Theopolis.</p>

<p>By the name itself the place is bound by faith of some sort and maybe it is the central form of their government since Dominus is the one who sentenced criminals to be exiled instead of imprisonment or execution.</p>

<p>They thought they could become God or are working for God but ended up doing shit for Nightmare. Also Emperor Voll in ACT IV is somewhat similar as he thought he was doing the right thing but ended up a farmable boss that gives lots of exp and loot.</p>

<p>[/spoiler]</p>

<h2 id="other-games-i-played-before">Other games I played before</h2>

<p>[spoiler title=&#8221;Spoiler Alert&#8221;]</p>

<p>In Final Fantasy Tactics, St. Ajora is the preacher known early in the game but in truth he is the host to the demon that is the final boss.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In Alundra, the main antagonist is Melzas. He was worshipped by the people in town and was praying to him. Their prayers gives him powers and the village priest also helps him to deceive the people to worship him.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Well, in Star Craft there was this Xel&#8217;Naga the Protoss believed to be helping them but in the end it was Amon. Also the last boss of the game.<br />
[/spoiler]</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Some games on the top of my head are Warcraft, Final Fantasy Tactics, Alundra, Final Fantasy 7, Terranigma. Xenogears. Valkyrie Profile. Well I could be wrong with these, will need to play them again and will add more. I&#8217;m just sure about Alundra, Tactics, Path of Exile, Warcraft and Star Craft</p>

<p>Think I missed some of your favorites? Feel free to add your list on the comments and I might get to try out something new.</p>

            <description>I was checking out some job openings at Upwork(WHICH I NEVER GET HIRED EVEN BEFORE WHEN IT WAS ODESK) and other freelance/job post sites. There were many people looking for &amp;#8220;Experts&amp;#8221;. WordPress Experts, Design Experts, SEO Experts, PHP Experts, Rockstar Designers blah blah blah.
Questions started to pop up one after another which I can&amp;#8217;t even answer. Am I an expert? I&amp;#8217;ve been customizing and building websites from some time but I can&amp;#8217;t consider myself an expert.</description>

<p>Questions started to pop up one after another which I can&#8217;t even answer. Am I an expert? I&#8217;ve been customizing and building websites from some time but I can&#8217;t consider myself an expert.</p>

<p>Is there a gauge or a scale we can use to measure up our expertise? Maybe like a scouter in Dragon Ball which measures power/expertise levels.</p>

<p>A quick google search on expert gives us this &#8220;An expert, more generally, is a person with extensive knowledge or ability based on research, experience, or occupation and in a particular area of study.&#8221;</p>

<p>Well with that definition I can say that I&#8217;m an expert but for now I&#8217;d stick to &#8220;Experienced&#8221; or &#8220;Practiced&#8221; maybe.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s all for today, just a random rant out of a random thought. How about you guys? Are you experts? Is there a certain level before you can consider someone an expert? Please do let me know by leaving a comment below.</p>

            <title>So many games so little time: Plants vs Zombies</title>

            <description>Hello, I&amp;#8217;ve decided to write about games I played. Sort of a review but not in-depth, there are many other sites that focus on that.
This time we&amp;#8217;ll be talking about Plants vs Zombies.
It came out around 2009 when I was still in college, some of my friends introduced me to it.
At first I found it weird. Usual tower defense games have the camera position on top but this is like playing Mario and other side scrolling games.</description>

<p>This time we&#8217;ll be talking about Plants vs Zombies.</p>

<p>It came out around 2009 when I was still in college, some of my friends introduced me to it.</p>

<p>At first I found it weird. Usual tower defense games have the camera position on top but this is like playing Mario and other side scrolling games. Before I knew it was playing for more than 8 hours straight in story mode.</p>

<p>Gameplay is simple, the plants are there in the lawn to stop the zombies from coming into your house and eat your brains. Just place plants for each lane to survive the zombie waves.</p>

<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-169 size-large" src="http://johncosio.com/app/uploads/2016/08/survival-endless-e1472618660843-3.png" width="550" height="309" /></p>

<p>I think the main feature that makes this game so addictive is the Survival Endless mini-game. The goal is to survive as many rounds and to think of different setups of plants to last that long. I&#8217;ve seen some do thousands but my highest is only 78 Flags. 😀</p>

<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-170 size-large" src="http://johncosio.com/app/uploads/2016/08/loading-3.png" alt="zen-garden" width="550" height="309" /></p>

<p>There is the Zen Garden mode. You can collect the plants in the game and water it and grow it then just watch them move around.</p>

<p>Overall a fun and highly repeatable game to keep you entertained and busy for hours. You can also share your highest survival scores and strategy with friends.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s all for now.</p>

<p>See you guys again, bye!</p>

            <description>Ever played Spore, StarCraft and Warcraft strategy games? Spore lets you create vehicles, creatures and buildings and more. It was really a good game and I enjoyed busting planets and evolving creatures and mixing body parts and whatever.
I&amp;#8217;ve stumbled upon some of my creations when I played it before. Doing some art in-game. Check it out.
My spore version of the Hydralisk. It kinda looks like a cuter imitation. Hahaha</description>

This is how he ended up in spore creature creator. A little closer to how they really look.</p>

<p>Disclaimer:</p>

<p>The Sporecraft from the title is something that I made up from mixing up Spore and StarCraft/Warcraft. It is not related in any way to the Minecraft mod to Spore and other games of the same name that comes up when you search it.</p>

            <description>Not feeling good.
Brains not working well.
Just laying on the sofa.
Channel surfing until finding an interesting show.
Watching some Key &amp;amp; Peele skits online.
Playing mobile games.
Browse lolcats.
There are just days that things don&amp;#8217;t seem to be productive as you&amp;#8217;d like to. I&amp;#8217;ll just declare this day as a national day-off and might as well write something here.
I think cats can understand how I&amp;#8217;m feeling right now.</description>

<p>I think cats can understand how I&#8217;m feeling right now. Some of them look really bored, lazy and relaxed.</p>

<p>Anyway that&#8217;s all about it. Relaxin&#8217; and lazing around. Doesn&#8217;t make sense? Ummm yeah, doesn&#8217;t even have to.</p>

            <description>Hello! This is my first post. I used to have another blog and use this as my landing page but it is now inactive.
I&amp;#8217;ll be trying to use this from now on. I haven&amp;#8217;t really thought about what to write here. I just want to be able search myself correctly from Google results.
Maybe next time I&amp;#8217;ll land on the number one spot.
By the way I really like black backgrounds with shiny life stream like images from FF7.</description>

<p>Well that&#8217;s about it for the first post. Hope I&#8217;ll be able to write again soon.</p>
