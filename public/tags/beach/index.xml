      <description>Good time to go to beach Was getting burnt out after a really hard project.
I didn&amp;#8217;t like beaches because it&amp;#8217;s hot and I don&amp;#8217;t know how to swim.
Somehow when trying out surfing it was really fun.
It&amp;#8217;s like skating but on waves!
Plus it doesn&amp;#8217;t hurt as much when falling into water.
 &amp;nbsp;
Now on to catching bigger waves&amp;#8230;
Oh. Need to learn how to swim first.</description>
