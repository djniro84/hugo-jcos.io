      <description>Had a quick gig on the Disney Aulani site when I was still at RCG.
Mostly worked on the front-end implementation of redesign.
Just did the CSS and a little template here and there.
  So starting from this page until checkout are what I&amp;#8217;ve worked on this project.
It was straightforward but there were many changes done.
Skills: PHP, HTML5, CSS3, Web design</description>

      <description>Model Kit:    SD Gundam EX-Standard Sinanju  Trying something different with the layouts.  Also playing around with changing the Gundam&amp;#8217;s color with this one.   Before   After   A quick edit with colors.
Changing from red to blue and the guns near the eyes.
More practice with glowing things like the gun scopes and eye.
Sometime in the future I would like to paint this.</description>

      <description>Model Kit: SD Gundam Cross Silhouette Crossbone Gundam X1
Hello, here we are again with another GIMP Complete.
I finished over during the holidays. Had some problems using my Mother&amp;#8217;s laptop. It was just shutting down without warning.
Can&amp;#8217;t blame the laptop since it&amp;#8217;s really old. Stopped running Windows XP and had to reformat with Linux.
LXLE made it usable again but that&amp;#8217;s a story for another time.
Setting up I need to get some base to pose the Gundam in the air.</description>

Subject is the Gundam Deathscythe-Hell EW version.
Practicing adding glowing things to eyes and the scythe.
Before 
After 
I got some more posts coming up. Cleaning up the Gundam Crossbones and working on the SD Sinanju.
Still 2 more SD then moving on to my MG kit or get some HG for practice.
This is actually quite relaxing. Haven&amp;#8217;t opened Steam in a while.</description>

      <description>My first project using WordPress and working with Dart back in September 2013. Developed a WordPress child theme of twentyeleven from an already designed HTML template.
Second redesign was around March of 2015. The new theme was a responsive theme with a request to add a survey to get user feedback. The survey is mandatory and needs to be finished first before viewers can access the content.
Redesign results shows that it engages more users to access the site especially those that are using mobile devices, better ways to improve the website by taking into account viewer feedback and demographics.</description>

      <description>One of the projects with Dart. This involves lots of customization to themes and especially WooCommerce.
The projects is an online shop but for registered members only. Since this is a niche site and shop a customized wish-list was placed to inquire about items. Built using Bootstrap, Parallax, Masonry Galleries and other design requests this is one of the bandwidth-heavy sites I&amp;#8217;ve created. Forgot to mention that videos was used as background for home and contact pages.</description>
