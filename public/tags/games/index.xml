      <description>Hey there! Just finished Crashlands. I really enjoyed every session and lost some sleep. Just one more recipeee!!!
Crashlands was released in 2016, I was pretty late for the party but no worries still got to play it. It went on sale some time ago on Steam and Google play so I went with the Android version since I thought I might be able to play that more often(Also cheaper).</description>

      <description>Well hello there! Got some new toys from humblebundle.com. Pretty good deal at $15 you get 7-8 games.
First time in a while playing some games that actually have and ending.
For some time I was into MMORPGs, DoTA, mobile games(Clash of Clans, Summoners War) but sometimes it&amp;#8217;s good to go back to basics.
Back in the day you play games until you see The End, Fin.
It was a really good feeling to watch the credits.</description>

      <title>Game storyline with false gods</title>

      <description>Hey there, I noticed this trend with some of the games I played recently and from some time ago. The game storyline involves a God like figure at the beginning then ends up to be the main antagonist or false at the end.
Spoiler Alert: Some games only reveals this when on the last boss or at the later parts of the game.
The latest game that I&amp;#8217;m currently playing is Path of Exile, I wanted to play some Action Role Playing Games after I finished the Star Craft 2: Legacy of the Void story.</description>

      <description>Hello, I&amp;#8217;ve decided to write about games I played. Sort of a review but not in-depth, there are many other sites that focus on that.
This time we&amp;#8217;ll be talking about Plants vs Zombies.
It came out around 2009 when I was still in college, some of my friends introduced me to it.
At first I found it weird. Usual tower defense games have the camera position on top but this is like playing Mario and other side scrolling games.</description>

      <description>Ever played Spore, StarCraft and Warcraft strategy games? Spore lets you create vehicles, creatures and buildings and more. It was really a good game and I enjoyed busting planets and evolving creatures and mixing body parts and whatever.
I&amp;#8217;ve stumbled upon some of my creations when I played it before. Doing some art in-game. Check it out.
My spore version of the Hydralisk. It kinda looks like a cuter imitation. Hahaha</description>
