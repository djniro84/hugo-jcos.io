      <description>One of the projects with Dart. This involves lots of customization to themes and especially WooCommerce.
The projects is an online shop but for registered members only. Since this is a niche site and shop a customized wish-list was placed to inquire about items. Built using Bootstrap, Parallax, Masonry Galleries and other design requests this is one of the bandwidth-heavy sites I&amp;#8217;ve created. Forgot to mention that videos was used as background for home and contact pages.</description>
