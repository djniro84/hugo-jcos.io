      <description>This is my first take on painting with GIMP.
Subject is the Gundam Deathscythe-Hell EW version.
Practicing adding glowing things to eyes and the scythe.
Before 
After 
I got some more posts coming up. Cleaning up the Gundam Crossbones and working on the SD Sinanju.
Still 2 more SD then moving on to my MG kit or get some HG for practice.
This is actually quite relaxing. Haven&amp;#8217;t opened Steam in a while.</description>

      <description>So after looking around on how to paint and what best way to do this I ended up coloring and working on this using my computer.
This is the previous SD we built &amp;#8211; Wing Gundam EW
Before editing using GIMP Before editing
After editing Cleaned up some nubs, changes colors and a lot more easier done.

Pros of using computer  Cheaper I didn&amp;#8217;t have to buy any paint Faster, it is seen asap.</description>

      <description>KIT: SD Gundam EX-Standard Wing Gundam Zero EW Series: Gundam Wing We have another SD from Gundam Wing.
The Gundam of Heero Yuy. It&amp;#8217;s really cool but I like the Deathscythe more, personal preference I guess.
I wanted to start painting but currently still looking and learning from tutorials online.
I&amp;#8217;m not sure if this EW batch of SD have all of the EW Gundams but it would be great to collect all.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve actually posted the edited version first in GIMP Complete
Model Kit: SD Gundam EX-Standard Gundam Deathscythe-Hell EW
I enjoy building these kits then posing them around then taking photos.
Figured I can edit them to add details then clean up nubs.
Picture time!                Tried editing the background out and replacing with space.

      <description>Some info Last week I got back from Japan. Write about Japan Trip here&amp;#8230; &amp;lt;- Future link
While I was there, the toys especially Gundam kits seems cheaper so I picked up a couple.
Built my first Gundam The first Gundam series I saw was Gundam Wing in our local channel GMA 7 when I was a kid.
Duo&amp;#8217;s Deathscythe was my favorite and was really lucky I got to pick this up.</description>
