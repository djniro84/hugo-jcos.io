      <description>Hello! I&amp;#8217;m here again. Adding some updates and changing some stuff around here.
How are you doing?
So I was thinking about some stuff. When I first created my website it was just so I can create one for myself.
To be able to add to my resume. Thought it could come handy during interviews like &amp;#8220;Hey I have experience with WordPress and stuff. Check my email I use my own domain&amp;#8221; then I was learning a lot.</description>
