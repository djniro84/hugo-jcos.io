      <description>Hello! I&amp;#8217;m here again. Adding some updates and changing some stuff around here.
How are you doing?
So I was thinking about some stuff. When I first created my website it was just so I can create one for myself.
To be able to add to my resume. Thought it could come handy during interviews like &amp;#8220;Hey I have experience with WordPress and stuff. Check my email I use my own domain&amp;#8221; then I was learning a lot.</description>

      <description>I was checking out some job openings at Upwork(WHICH I NEVER GET HIRED EVEN BEFORE WHEN IT WAS ODESK) and other freelance/job post sites. There were many people looking for &amp;#8220;Experts&amp;#8221;. WordPress Experts, Design Experts, SEO Experts, PHP Experts, Rockstar Designers blah blah blah.
Questions started to pop up one after another which I can&amp;#8217;t even answer. Am I an expert? I&amp;#8217;ve been customizing and building websites from some time but I can&amp;#8217;t consider myself an expert.</description>

      <description>Not feeling good.
Brains not working well.
Just laying on the sofa.
Channel surfing until finding an interesting show.
Watching some Key &amp;amp; Peele skits online.
Playing mobile games.
Browse lolcats.
There are just days that things don&amp;#8217;t seem to be productive as you&amp;#8217;d like to. I&amp;#8217;ll just declare this day as a national day-off and might as well write something here.
I think cats can understand how I&amp;#8217;m feeling right now.</description>
