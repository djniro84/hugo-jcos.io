      <description>Model Kit:    SD Gundam EX-Standard Sinanju  Trying something different with the layouts.  Also playing around with changing the Gundam&amp;#8217;s color with this one.   Before   After   A quick edit with colors.
Changing from red to blue and the guns near the eyes.
More practice with glowing things like the gun scopes and eye.
Sometime in the future I would like to paint this.</description>

      <description>Completed another SD kit.
Getting the hang of it now. My brother has been building an HG kit and he said it took him around 3 hours or more so looking at 2 more SDs then going for an HG or straight to my MG on stand by.
