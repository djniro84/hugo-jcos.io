      <description>Model Kit:    SD Gundam EX-Standard Sinanju  Trying something different with the layouts.  Also playing around with changing the Gundam&amp;#8217;s color with this one.   Before   After   A quick edit with colors.
Changing from red to blue and the guns near the eyes.
More practice with glowing things like the gun scopes and eye.
Sometime in the future I would like to paint this.</description>

      <description>Model Kit: SD Gundam Cross Silhouette Crossbone Gundam X1
Hello, here we are again with another GIMP Complete.
I finished over during the holidays. Had some problems using my Mother&amp;#8217;s laptop. It was just shutting down without warning.
Can&amp;#8217;t blame the laptop since it&amp;#8217;s really old. Stopped running Windows XP and had to reformat with Linux.
LXLE made it usable again but that&amp;#8217;s a story for another time.
Setting up I need to get some base to pose the Gundam in the air.</description>

      <description>This is my first take on painting with GIMP.
Subject is the Gundam Deathscythe-Hell EW version.
Practicing adding glowing things to eyes and the scythe.
Before 
After 
I got some more posts coming up. Cleaning up the Gundam Crossbones and working on the SD Sinanju.
Still 2 more SD then moving on to my MG kit or get some HG for practice.
This is actually quite relaxing. Haven&amp;#8217;t opened Steam in a while.</description>

      <description>So after looking around on how to paint and what best way to do this I ended up coloring and working on this using my computer.
This is the previous SD we built &amp;#8211; Wing Gundam EW
Before editing using GIMP Before editing
After editing Cleaned up some nubs, changes colors and a lot more easier done.

Pros of using computer  Cheaper I didn&amp;#8217;t have to buy any paint Faster, it is seen asap.</description>
