      <description>Ever played Spore, StarCraft and Warcraft strategy games? Spore lets you create vehicles, creatures and buildings and more. It was really a good game and I enjoyed busting planets and evolving creatures and mixing body parts and whatever.
I&amp;#8217;ve stumbled upon some of my creations when I played it before. Doing some art in-game. Check it out.
My spore version of the Hydralisk. It kinda looks like a cuter imitation. Hahaha</description>
