      <description>Hey there, I noticed this trend with some of the games I played recently and from some time ago. The game storyline involves a God like figure at the beginning then ends up to be the main antagonist or false at the end.
Spoiler Alert: Some games only reveals this when on the last boss or at the later parts of the game.
The latest game that I&amp;#8217;m currently playing is Path of Exile, I wanted to play some Action Role Playing Games after I finished the Star Craft 2: Legacy of the Void story.</description>

      <description>I was checking out some job openings at Upwork(WHICH I NEVER GET HIRED EVEN BEFORE WHEN IT WAS ODESK) and other freelance/job post sites. There were many people looking for &amp;#8220;Experts&amp;#8221;. WordPress Experts, Design Experts, SEO Experts, PHP Experts, Rockstar Designers blah blah blah.
Questions started to pop up one after another which I can&amp;#8217;t even answer. Am I an expert? I&amp;#8217;ve been customizing and building websites from some time but I can&amp;#8217;t consider myself an expert.</description>
