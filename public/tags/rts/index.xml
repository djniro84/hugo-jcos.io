      <description>Hello, I&amp;#8217;ve decided to write about games I played. Sort of a review but not in-depth, there are many other sites that focus on that.
This time we&amp;#8217;ll be talking about Plants vs Zombies.
It came out around 2009 when I was still in college, some of my friends introduced me to it.
At first I found it weird. Usual tower defense games have the camera position on top but this is like playing Mario and other side scrolling games.</description>
