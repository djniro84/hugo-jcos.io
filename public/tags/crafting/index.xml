      <description>Hey there! Just finished Crashlands. I really enjoyed every session and lost some sleep. Just one more recipeee!!!
Crashlands was released in 2016, I was pretty late for the party but no worries still got to play it. It went on sale some time ago on Steam and Google play so I went with the Android version since I thought I might be able to play that more often(Also cheaper).</description>
