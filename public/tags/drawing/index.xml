      <description>This here is the credit card debt(Death).
The idea of puns and credit card debt(Death) I wanted to start with drawing stuff like these for a long time and share it. If my memory serves me right, I was talking about this idea with my friends and drew it for more details.
After all, a picture is worth a thousand words.
We know the bad of having credit cards and even worse if you are deep and maxed it.</description>
