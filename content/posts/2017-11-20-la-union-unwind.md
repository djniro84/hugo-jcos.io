# Good time to go to beach

Was getting burnt out after a really hard project.

I didn&#8217;t like beaches because it&#8217;s hot and I don&#8217;t know how to swim.

Somehow when trying out surfing it was really fun.

It&#8217;s like skating but on waves!

Plus it doesn&#8217;t hurt as much when falling into water.

Now on to catching bigger waves&#8230;

Oh. Need to learn how to swim first.
