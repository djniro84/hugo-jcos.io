Hello! This is my first post. I used to have another blog and use this as my landing page but it is now inactive.

I&#8217;ll be trying to use this from now on. I haven&#8217;t really thought about what to write here. I just want to be able search myself correctly from Google results.

Maybe next time I&#8217;ll land on the number one spot.

By the way I really like black backgrounds with shiny life stream like images from [FF7](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy_VII).

Well that&#8217;s about it for the first post. Hope I&#8217;ll be able to write again soon.
