#### Model Kit: [SD Gundam EX-Standard Gundam Deathscythe-Hell EW](#)

[Build Complete: SD Gundam EX-Standard Sinanju](/uploads/20190415_012717.jpg)

Completed another SD kit.

Getting the hang of it now.

My brother has been building an HG kit and he said it took him around 3 hours or more.

I'm looking at 2 more SDs then going for an HG or straight to my MG on stand by.
