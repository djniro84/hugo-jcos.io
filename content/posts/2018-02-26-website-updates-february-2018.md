Hello! I&#8217;m here again. Adding some updates and changing some stuff around here.

How are you doing?

So I was thinking about some stuff. When I first created my website it was just so I can create one for myself.

To be able to add to my resume. Thought it could come handy during interviews like &#8220;Hey I have experience with WordPress and stuff. Check my email I use my own domain&#8221; then I was learning a lot.

There were some ideas of monetizing it, adding some ads, selling stuff but now I&#8217;ve decided to just write stuff.

Maybe the readers and the ads will come in time but that is not the target now.

With this I think I&#8217;ll be able to add more stuff since I&#8217;m not concerned about how many words in a post, does it pass SEO checklists. I&#8217;ve remove the ads. There are useless since there aren&#8217;t that many viewers and posts anyways. LOL

For now I&#8217;ll just make this like my personal page or something like my Facebook wall. Post whatever I want without anymore guidelines to follow. There were some stuff I was into back then like &#8220;How to get reader&#8217;s attention with titles&#8221;, &#8220;Make quality content to get followers&#8221;, &#8220;[How to monetize your website](http://jcos.io/ways-make-money-website/)&#8221; and so on.

Since I just use Facebook for messenger. (People are still easier to contact with Facebook/Messenger)

I have a feeling I&#8217;ll be able to update this more often now.

Also, I&#8217;ve updated the homepage. I really like it a lot better now with the skate park.

That&#8217;s all for now.

See ya
