Well hello there! Got some new toys from [humblebundle.com](http://www.humblebundle.com/). Pretty good deal at $15 you get 7-8 games.

First time in a while playing some games that actually have and ending.

For some time I was into MMORPGs, DoTA, mobile games(Clash of Clans, Summoners War) but sometimes it&#8217;s good to go back to basics.

Back in the day you play games until you see **The End**, **Fin.**

It was a really good feeling to watch the credits.

## **Steam and humble bundle**

I&#8217;ll be busy playing the Borderlands series included in the bundle. Feels refreshing to play single player story games again.

Now time to play. Starting with Borderlands.

&nbsp;

Until next game!
