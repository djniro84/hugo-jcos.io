## After

A quick edit with colors.

Changing from red to blue and the guns near the eyes.

More practice with glowing things like the gun scopes and eye.

Sometime in the future I would like to paint this.

Also I&#8217;ve recorded the editing so I can post some speed edit videos. Yey!

One more SD remaining from initial stocks (Might buy 1 last more).

Unicorn Phenex up next!

Saving the Magnum for last in this set.
