This here is the credit card debt(Death).

## The idea of puns and credit card debt(Death)

I wanted to start with drawing stuff like these for a long time and share it. If my memory serves me right, I was talking about this idea with my friends and drew it for more details.

After all, a picture is worth a thousand words.

We know the bad of having credit cards and even worse if you are deep and maxed it.

## What&#8217;s next?

Make a digital version of this draft. I&#8217;m gonna do this in GIMP, paint or try to draw in my phone with some apps.
