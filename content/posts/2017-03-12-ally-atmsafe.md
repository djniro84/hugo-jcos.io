## A web application that communicates with mainframe for account enrollments and posting of payment updates.

This project is the first time I was assigned as team leader, serves as an API to pass information to the bank mainframe and process information to update customer&#8217;s account status and balance.

Built with JSP as view, jQuery for the UI and PostgreSQL for the database.

The system generates monthly reports in CSV format that is readable in COBOL. Configured a Centos Server as production environment.

Skills: Java, Javascript, JQuery, AJAX, HTML, CSS, PostgreSQL, Centos
