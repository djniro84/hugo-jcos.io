My first project using WordPress and working with [Dart](http://www.darttiglao.com/) back in September 2013. Developed a WordPress child theme of twentyeleven from an already designed HTML template.

Second redesign was around March of 2015. The new theme was a responsive theme with a request to add a survey to get user feedback. The survey is mandatory and needs to be finished first before viewers can access the content.

Redesign results shows that it engages more users to access the site especially those that are using mobile devices, better ways to improve the website by taking into account viewer feedback and demographics.

Site was built with WordPress for Content Management, HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap and Survey Monkey.

## The site home page.
