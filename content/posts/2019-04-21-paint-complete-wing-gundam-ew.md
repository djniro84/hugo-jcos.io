So after looking around on how to paint and what best way to do this I ended up coloring and working on this using my computer.

This is the previous SD we built &#8211; [Wing Gundam EW](https://jcos.io/wing-gundam-ew/)

## Pros of using computer

  * Cheaper I didn&#8217;t have to buy any paint
  * Faster, it is seen asap. Does not need to wait for paint to dry.
  * Can look really good depending on skill level. (Still starting out, my second shot at this)
  * Can easily remove nubs as well

## Cons

  * Can&#8217;t really display the finished product since only digital
  * Sometimes it&#8217;s hard to use mouse with drawings
  * That&#8217;s all I can think for now

Only video I saw so far which I used for reference &#8211; 



## Tools for editing

  * GIMP

GIMP because it&#8217;s free and this is only a hobby I do when there&#8217;s time to spare so no need for Photoshop.

Yeah that&#8217;s it for now. Just a lot of googling and see what looks good.
