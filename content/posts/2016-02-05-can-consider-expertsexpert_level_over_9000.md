I was checking out some job openings at [Upwork](http://www.upwork.com/o/profiles/users/_~01e9d0d8b8a4b0a844/)(WHICH I NEVER GET HIRED EVEN BEFORE WHEN IT WAS ODESK) and other freelance/job post sites. There were many people looking for &#8220;Experts&#8221;. WordPress Experts, Design Experts, SEO Experts, PHP Experts, Rockstar Designers blah blah blah.

Questions started to pop up one after another which I can&#8217;t even answer. Am I an expert? I&#8217;ve been customizing and building websites from some time but I can&#8217;t consider myself an expert.

Is there a gauge or a scale we can use to measure up our expertise? Maybe like a scouter in Dragon Ball which measures power/expertise levels.

A quick google search on expert gives us this &#8220;An expert, more generally, is a person with extensive knowledge or ability based on research, experience, or occupation and in a particular area of study.&#8221;

Well with that definition I can say that I&#8217;m an expert but for now I&#8217;d stick to &#8220;Experienced&#8221; or &#8220;Practiced&#8221; maybe.

That&#8217;s all for today, just a random rant out of a random thought. How about you guys? Are you experts? Is there a certain level before you can consider someone an expert? Please do let me know by leaving a comment below.
