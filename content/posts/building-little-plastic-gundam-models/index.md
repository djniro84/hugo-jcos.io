#### Model Kit: [SD Gundam EX-Standard Gundam Deathscythe-Hell EW](#)

### Some info

Last week I got back from Japan.

While I was there, the toys especially Gundam kits seems cheaper so I picked up a couple.

### Built my first Gundam

The first Gundam series I saw was Gundam Wing in our local channel GMA 7 when I was a kid.

Duo’s Deathscythe was my favorite and was really lucky I got to pick this up.

### Building Process

I’ve had some toys like this when I was a little so it was fairly easy.

Follow the instructions even if written in Japanese is clear.

We can follow the images on which parts go to where.

Here’s some pics I took when doing the pieces.

### I need more

I think I’m addicted to this new hobby.

I’ve been planning to collect Gundams before since I had one kit when I was a kid and then realized that they’re expensive.

Currently reading and watching tutorials on painting and other stuff.

I’m not contented with the stickers when looking at other cool builds on the internet.

Also haven’t played a game when I got back.

Working on other SDs to get the hang of it.

### TLDR

Got and built a Gundam kit and hooked.

Know where to buy Gundam that ships internationally? Any good tutorials for beginner on painting?

Want to share your builds?

I’d love to talk and hear your recommendations.
