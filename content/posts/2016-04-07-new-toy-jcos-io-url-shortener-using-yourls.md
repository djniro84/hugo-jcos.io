Finding an unused domain name is hard, finding available short domains is even harder.

Last Christmas I got myself this new domain for my URL shortener. JCOS.IO yeah!

Nice present for myself.

I just finished setting it up again because I was busy with work and with life these past few months.

There was a problem with my previous install.

## A little introduction to URL shorteners. They make your links short. That is all. üòÄ

Why would you want to do that???

For example on twitter, the number of characters per tweet is limited to 140 characters. So if you have a really cool link you need to share to your followers and friends no matter what.

‚ÄúOMGSH!!! hey check out this really cool site. the squirrel is on a jet pack with laser guns and shoots when you click!!! <http://www.omglasergunspewpewpew.com/>‚Äù

This won&#8217;t do because this exceeds twitter&#8217;s tweet limit. By shortening our link we can be sure that the awesomeness will be shared.

‚ÄúOMGSH!!! hey check out this really cool site. the squirrel is on a jet pack with laser guns and shoots when you click!!! url.jcos.io/omgpewpew &#8211; <http://www.omglasergunspewpewpew.com/>‚Äù

Above example also exceeds tweet limit but you get the point.

Usually we&#8217;ll go to Bitly or TinyURL for our shortening needs but YOURLS lets us do the same on our own server. It even means Your Own URL Shortener and it&#8217;s free!

&nbsp;

I&#8217;m not going into details about how to set it up there are many other sites which provide detailed and easy to follow instructions like the following:

http://url.jcos.io/5 &#8211;¬†<https://trickspanda.com/install-yourls/>

&nbsp;

Even the instructions on yourls homepage is clear enough.

&nbsp;

I&#8217;ve also read that getting your own domain for URL shortener is great for branding. That&#8217;s cool if you&#8217;re into that thing. Branding, marketing and stuff.

Let me know if you&#8217;d like some help with setting up your own yourls by leaving a comment below.

**Update:**

As I&#8217;m moving to Digital Ocean and using jcos.io as primary domain, I think I won&#8217;t be needing to use a url shortener for now.

Added the original links and it really shortens stuff but I don&#8217;t even use twitter now so&#8230; Yeahhhh taking it down now.
