### Model Kit: [SD Gundam EX-Standard Wing Gundam Zero EW](#)

Series: [Gundam Wing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_Suit_Gundam_Wing)

We have another SD from Gundam Wing.

The Gundam of Heero Yuy. It’s really cool but I like the Deathscythe more, personal preference I guess.

I wanted to start painting but currently still looking and learning from tutorials online.

I’m not sure if this Endless Waltz batch of SD have all of the EW Gundams but it would be great to collect all.
