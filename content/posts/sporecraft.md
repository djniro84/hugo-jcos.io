Ever played Spore, StarCraft and Warcraft strategy games?

Spore lets you create vehicles, creatures and buildings and more.

It was really a good game and I enjoyed busting planets and evolving creatures and mixing body parts and whatever.

I’ve stumbled upon some of my creations when I played it before.

Doing some art in-game. Check it out.

My spore version of the Hydralisk.

It kinda looks like a cuter imitation Hahaha

I really like the Quillboar race from Warcraft and when playing DotA I used Rigwarl a lot.

This is how he ended up in spore creature creator.

A little closer to how they really look.
