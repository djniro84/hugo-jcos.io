+++

I was checking out some job openings at Upwork(WHICH I NEVER GET HIRED EVEN BEFORE WHEN IT WAS ODESK) and other freelance/job post sites.

There were many people looking for “Experts”.

WordPress Experts, Design Experts, SEO Experts, PHP Experts, Rockstar Designers blah blah blah.

What the heck does that even mean?

Then they are looking for the cheapest and fastest that can deliver.

Is that even possible?

Questions started to pop up one after another which I can’t even answer.

Am I an expert?

I’ve been customizing and building websites from some time but I can’t consider myself an expert.

Is there a gauge or a scale we can use to measure up our expertise? Maybe like a scouter in Dragon Ball which measures power/expertise levels.

A quick google search on expert gives us this “An expert, more generally, is a person with extensive knowledge or ability based on research, experience, or occupation and in a particular area of study.”

Well with that definition I can say that I’m an expert but for now I’d stick to “Experienced” or “Practiced” maybe.

That’s all for today, just a random rant out of a random thought.

How about you guys? Are you experts? Is there a certain level before you can consider someone an expert?

Please do let me know by leaving a comment below.
