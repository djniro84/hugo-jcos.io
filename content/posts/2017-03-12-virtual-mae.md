One of the projects with [Dart](http://www.darttiglao.com/). This involves lots of customization to themes and especially WooCommerce.

The projects is an online shop but for registered members only. Since this is a niche site and shop a customized wish-list was placed to inquire about items. Built using Bootstrap, Parallax, Masonry Galleries and other design requests this is one of the bandwidth-heavy sites I&#8217;ve created. Forgot to mention that videos was used as background for home and contact pages.

End product was a working E-Commerce site that accepts and processes orders by direct communication of the owner and clients.

Site was built with WordPress for Content Management, HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap.

Skills: Java, Javascript, JQuery, AJAX, HTML, CSS, PostgreSQL, Centos
