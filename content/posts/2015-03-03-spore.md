Ever played Spore, StarCraft and Warcraft strategy games? Spore lets you create vehicles, creatures and buildings and more. It was really a good game and I enjoyed busting planets and evolving creatures and mixing body parts and whatever.

I&#8217;ve stumbled upon some of my creations when I played it before. Doing some art in-game. Check it out.

This is how he ended up in spore creature creator. A little closer to how they really look.

The Sporecraft from the title is something that I made up from mixing up Spore and StarCraft/Warcraft. It is not related in any way to the Minecraft mod to Spore and other games of the same name that comes up when you search it.
