#### Model Kit: [SD Gundam EX-Standard Gundam Deathscythe-Hell EW](/build-complete-sd-gundam-cross-silhouette-crossbone-gundam-x1/)

This is my first take on painting with GIMP.

Subject is the Gundam Deathscythe-Hell EW version.

Practicing adding glowing things to eyes and the scythe.

I got some more posts coming up. Cleaning up the Gundam Crossbones and working on the SD Sinanju.

Still 2 more SD then moving on to my MG kit or get some HG for practice.

This is actually quite relaxing. Havenâ€™t opened Steam in a while.
