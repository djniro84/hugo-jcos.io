Not feeling good.

Brains not working well.

Just laying on the sofa.

Channel surfing until finding an interesting show.

Watching some [Key & Peele](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__d2FMCtgi4) skits online.

Playing mobile games.

Browse [lolcats](http://www.lolcats.com/).

There are just days that things don&#8217;t seem to be productive as you&#8217;d like to. I&#8217;ll just declare this day as a national day-off and might as well write something here.

I think cats can understand how I&#8217;m feeling right now. Some of them look really bored, lazy and relaxed.

Anyway that&#8217;s all about it. Relaxin&#8217; and lazing around. Doesn&#8217;t make sense? Ummm yeah, doesn&#8217;t even have to.
