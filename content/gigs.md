## Hey there!

Gigs.. Sounds like a band doing shows and tours. That was also one of my &#8220;when I grow up I want to be a guitarist in a band and rock!&#8221;. The only thing happened inside that quotation is that &#8220;I grew up&#8221;. Now on to moving on to serious matters.

This page may contain one-time work or open-source side projects on [Github](https://github.com).

I&#8217;d like to contribute to applications I regularly use. Doing that kind of makes it fun, since if a feature I created gets included in a project, everybody wins. Looking for my first merge!

I&#8217;m looking at [fiverr](https://www.fiverr.com/) and [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/) but best way for now is to drop me an email at **contact@jcos.io**

There&#8217;s also the artsy stuff.

I&#8217;ve done some drawings using pencil and tissue while drinking somewhere like the image on the right.

Translation: The scythe is made from credit cards&#8230;. so credit card death(debt)

I can also do logo creations and photo editing.

The featured image is made with GIMP then playing around with layers, transparency stuff. I remember entering that in a submit your photo contest online but turned out it was a numbers of like contest. Lost interest immediately&#8230; When I was in high school I wanted to be a professional skater, result of too much Tony Hawk&#8217;s Pro Skater 2 so it was fun to be in an actual skate park. Even just sitting around.

Pretty sure there&#8217;s none of that in my country.

Made my logo using GIMP then Inkscape. <i class="gig-logo"></i>

Notice how it looks like a terminal icon then I&#8217;ve added my initials JC there?

I&#8217;m just happy with it, feeling so creative here. I dunno if there could be tons like that online.

Anyway, that&#8217;s all for now. There&#8217;s more for another time.

If you want to keep in touch here&#8217;s my card.

Oh and please do subscribe in my newsletter. (None yet! Email for now) Thank you!

I don&#8217;t know what news I&#8217;ll send maybe some offers or weather.

On second thought there&#8217;s the GDPR stuff about data usage policy and I&#8217;m too lazy to work on that now&#8230;

Looking into this for later.

See you around!
