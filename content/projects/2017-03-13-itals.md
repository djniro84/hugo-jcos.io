## A portal application to track employee’s hours and activities to productivity data as reports.

This project is from Philippine National Bank. I started working on this system as a team leader and project manager after taking up a Spring Framework course. Developed with Spring Framework for the system logic and back-end.  jQuery UI for the datepicker and other dynamic elements.

Configured a Centos Server as production environment.

Skills: Java, JSP, Javascript, JQuery, AJAX, Spring Framework, HTML, CSS, PostgreSQL, Project Management, Task delegation to team
