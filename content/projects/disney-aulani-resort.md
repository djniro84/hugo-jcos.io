Had a quick gig on the Disney Aulani site when I was still at RCG.

Mostly worked on the front-end implementation of redesign.

Just did the CSS and a little template here and there.

![Aulani Room Rates page](/uploads/aulani-page.jpg)

So starting from this page until checkout are what I&#8217;ve worked on this project.

It was straightforward but there were many changes done.
