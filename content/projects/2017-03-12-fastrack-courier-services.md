## Web administration and booking application for a fast growing logistics company.

Involved in the overall improvement of their current system which deals with the system flow and the actual operation process.  
Streamlined the booking and processing of bookings by filtering and reducing redundant bookings per day to only show unique records.

Updated the functionality to give a clear and straightforward process into using the website that results in a smoother user experience.

Collaborated with 3rd party software providers to integrate their services with the current system. An example is one provider that process bookings via SMS then then updates the database.

Skills: PHP, WordPress, Theme development, HTML5, CSS3, MySQL, Web design, Responsive design, AngularJS, Project Management
