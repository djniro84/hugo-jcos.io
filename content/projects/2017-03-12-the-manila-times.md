## The online newspaper for The Manila Times, the oldest newspaper of the Philippines.

With the help of my team, I redesigned the website for mobile responsiveness, better editorial process and reader engagement.  
The redesign doubled website hits to 1.5 million a month, lowered bounce rate by 20% and improved ad revenue by attracting and accommodating more advertisers.

Skills: PHP, WordPress, Theme development, HTML5, CSS3, MySQL, Web design, Responsive design
