Hello, my name is John Cosio. Iâ€™m a programmer, webmaster and all-around computer guy.

I build websites from simple blog pages to complicated E-commerce sites.

Tools of the trade: PHP, Java, JSP, Servlets, Jquery, AngularJS, MVC, WordPress, Front end development and responsive mobile web design.

Java is not my cup ofâ€¦. water. Not much of a coffee or tea drinker.

Too complicated for me and back in college I used to skip classes. hahahaha

Not funny? Okay, letâ€™s forget that happened. ![ðŸ™‚](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/svg/1f642.svg)

Check out the [projects](/projects) page to see some of my work..

No need for fancy buzzwords, feel free to contact me if I could be of any help.
